= Installing Raspbian on Linux

This section contains a description for installing https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspbian[Rasbian] on a micro SD card using with a Linux computer, using the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface[commandline interface].

== Download Rasbian

With the following https://tldr.ostera.io/curl[`curl`] command you can download the latest Rasbian release into the "Downloads" of your home directory "~".
The file size is around 3 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigabyte[GB], so you will need a good internet connection and some patience.

[source, bash]
----
curl --location https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspbian_full_latest > ~/Downloads/raspbian-latest.zip
----

Afterwards, the downloaded file needs to be unzipped.

[source, bash]
----
unzip ~/Downloads/raspbian-latest.zip -d /tmp
mv /tmp/*-raspbian-*.img /tmp/raspbian-latest.img # <1>
----
<1> With this https://tldr.ostera.io/mv[`mv`] command the IMG file with the Raspian system will be renamed to a filename which doesn't include its version number.

== Locate SD Card

After plugging in the SD card, you need to find out its device name.
This can be done with the help of the https://www.howtoforge.com/linux-lsblk-command/[`lsblk`] command.

[source, bash]
----
lsblk -p
----

One way to determine the correct device name is to find the value matching with the micro SD card in the "SIZE" column.

.Example output for device overview
image::img/device-name.png[]

Now you can store the correct device name in a variable which can the be used in the following steps.

With the help of the https://tldr.ostera.io/grep[`grep`] command you can double check that you have entered the correct value.

[source, bash]
----
lsblk -p | grep $DEVICE_NAME
----

.Example output for check if correct device name was selected
image::img/check-device-name.png[]

[source, bash]
----
DEVICE_NAME=/dev/sdx
----

== Unmount micro SD card

If the device is https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/introduction-to-mounting-filesystems-in-linux/[mounted] into your file system tree, you need to https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/introduction-to-mounting-filesystems-in-linux/[unmount] it now with the https://tldr.ostera.io/umount[`umount`] command.

.Test test test
[source, bash]
----
umount $DEVICE_NAME* # <1>
----
<1> The asterisk after the variable is a http://tldp.org/LDP/GNU-Linux-Tools-Summary/html/x11655.htm[wildcard] character which will execute the command for all the partions on the device.

== Copy image to micro SD card

WARNING: The following step will overwrite all existing data on the target device. If you have entered a wrong value in the variable `DEVICE_NAME`, it may lead to a undesired data loss.

Finally, you can copy the Raspbian image on the micro SD card with the https://tldr.ostera.io/dd[`dd`] command. This needs to be prefix with the https://tldr.ostera.io/sudo[`sudo`] command to give `dd` the necessary permissions.

[source, bash]
----
sudo dd bs=4M if=/tmp/raspbian-latest.img of=$DEVICE_NAME status=progress conv=fsync
----

After this is done, you can unplug the micro SD card.
