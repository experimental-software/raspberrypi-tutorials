== Introduction

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Studio_Code[Visual Studio Code], or short VS Code, is an open source text editor developed from Microsoft.

For languages like Java, programmers usually use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) which is optimised for the respective environment.
However, there is always the need to edit text files outside of the main project, e.g. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_script[shell scripts], utility scripts with Python, notes and documentation.
Here it may be useful to have another general purpose text editor at hand.

At the moment, VS Code is the most popular of them.
